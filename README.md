# MVP week 6

This MVP-Project is putting to use what we have learned during the last 6 weeks of the Full Stack Development course by CodeOp, Barcelona.

## Setup

### Dependencies

- Run `npm install`in your project directory. This will install server-related dependencies such as `express`.
- `cd client`and run `npm install`. This will install the client dependencies (React and React-Router).

### Database Prep

- Run 'npm run migrate' in your project directory. This will import the required database ????????????????????????????????????????????

### Development

- Run `npm start`in your project directory to start the Express Server on port 4000.
- In another terminal, do `cd client`and run `npm run dev`to start the client in development mode with hot reloading in port 5173.
