# MVP week 6 - A lord of the rings game

This MVP-Project is putting to use what we have learned during the last 6 weeks of the Full Stack Development course by CodeOp, Barcelona.

It displays a lord of the rings-theme game, in which the player has to guess the right character to a given quote. There are 5 rounds to the game, each correct answer is rewarded with 1 point, each wrong answer with 0 points. In the end there is an overview of the achieved amount as well as a Win/Lose statement.

## Setup

### Dependencies

- Run `npm install`in your project directory. This will install server-related dependencies such as `express`.
